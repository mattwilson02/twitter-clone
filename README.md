## Twitter Clone API using Rust and Actix Web

This is my first time writing an API using Rust, so I am creating a simple structure containing `tweets` and `likes` and I will write the HTTP methods to update them.

For now I will not connect to a database, but rather mock my responses.

### Usage

`cargo run`
