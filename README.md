## Twitter Clone API using Rust and Actix Web

This is my first time writing an API using Rust, so I am creating a simple structure containing `tweets` and `likes` and I will write the HTTP methods to update them.

I am using [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/docs/getting-started) as a `crate` to manage my HTTP server.

For now I will not connect to a database, but rather mock my responses.

### Usage

ðŸ“¦ `cargo run`
